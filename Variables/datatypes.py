# ##################  Data Types ##################  

# #### String 🧵 ####
# # When we create Strings, we need to create them with double quotes ("") around the string we want
# # This is because this is a string of characters

# # Getting characters from string using bracket notation
# print("The below prints out the first character")
# print("Hello"[0])

# # Getting characters from string using bracket notation
# print("The below prints out the first character")
# print("Hello"[0])

# print()
# name = "Tom Tan"
# print("We can also splice and slice our string to get a substring")

# # Get character @ 0, 1, 2 index
# first_name = print(name[0:3])
# # If we do not put an end_index, it will take all the characters from the start_index
# # last character of the string
# last_name = print(name[4:])

# # String concatenation
# print()
# first_name = "Tom"
# last_name = "Tan"
# print(first_name + " " + last_name)
# print()

# ###### Integer 🔢 ######
# age = 15
# print(number)

# ###### Float 5️⃣⚫ ######
# decimal_number = 12.15
# print(decimal_number)


# ###### Type Error & Type Conversion ########
# age = 5
# print("My age is " + str(age))

# # ######## str -> int
# print("Recall that input() will take in user input, and this user input is of String data type")
# number_str = input("Please input your number: ")

# # We need to convert the number which is currently a string into int/float data type
# number_int = int(number_str)
# print(number_int + 5)

# # We can also immediate convert the user's input to int using function nesting
# number = int(input("Please input your number (This converts to int type straight away): "))
# print(number + 5)
# print()


# ######## int -> str
# print("We can convert integer into string")
# age_number = 20
# print("My age is " + str(age_number))

# number = 2.99999
# print(int(number) + 5)

# # We can also declare a new variable to store the age that is of type String
# age_number_str = str(age_number)
# print("My age is " + age_number_str)
